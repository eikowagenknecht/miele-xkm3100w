# miele-xkm3100w

Some example code of how to communicate with the Miele XKM3100W Wifi Module.

Config.java contains the configuration data for:
- Host
- Group ID
- Group Key

Test.java main method sends a request to the device and prints the response.

For now, Group ID and Group Key have to be identified either via Wireshark or the Android App's database.
